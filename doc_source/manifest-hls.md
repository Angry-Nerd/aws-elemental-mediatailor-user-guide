# HLS \.m3u8 Manifests<a name="manifest-hls"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaTailor supports `.m3u8` HLS manifests for live streaming and video on demand \(VOD\)\. When MediaTailor encounters an ad break, it attempts ad insertion or replacement, based on the type of content\. If there aren't enough ads to fill the duration, for the remainder of the ad break, MediaTailor displays the underlying content stream or the configured slate\. For more information about HLS ad behavior based on content type \(live or VOD\), see [Ad Behavior in AWS Elemental MediaTailor](ad-behavior.md)\.
